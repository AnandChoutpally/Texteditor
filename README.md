# Texteditor
 The Python program provided above demonstrates the creation of a basic text editor using the Tkinter library. Tkinter is a standard GUI toolkit for Python that allows developers to build graphical user interfaces.

 The text editor program utilizes a windowing system provided by Tkinter to create a graphical window with a text editing area. The program includes a menu bar with options for opening, saving, and exiting the application.

When the user selects the "Open" option from the file menu, a file dialog is displayed, allowing them to select a text file to open. Once a file is selected, its contents are read and displayed in the text editing area.

When the user selects the "Save" option from the file menu, a file dialog is displayed, enabling them to choose a location and provide a name for the file to save. The contents of the text editing area are then saved to the selected file.

The program provides support for opening and saving files with the extensions ".txt" and any other file types ("All Files"). If the user attempts to close the application using the "Exit" option in the file menu, the program terminates.

By running this Python program, users can launch a simple text editor interface that allows them to edit and save text files easily. They can open existing files, modify their contents, and save the changes back to the disk, providing a basic but functional text editing experience.
